French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly spoken of the &amp;#8220;European dimension&amp;#8221; to the French nuclear deterrent and his country&amp;#8217;s willingness to open a conversation about extending a French nuclear umbrella to Europe&amp;#8217;s non-nuclear states. In July 2025, France and the United Kingdom, Europe&amp;#8217;s two nuclear powers, announced stronger nuclear coordination in the Northwood Declaration, Lancaster House 2.0, and the U.K.-France Leaders Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a playground insult in Yalimo, Papua, escalated into a blaze that killed three people, wounded dozens and displaced more than 170 villagers, it exposed a stark truth about Indonesian democracy: laws, slogans and national ceremonies can mask a quieter illness —the everyday racism that, when triggered, turns neighbor against neighbor.

This was the first Zapad exercise since Russia&amp;#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The exercise was notably smaller than the previous one held in 2021. While Belarusian authorities presented the decrease in size as a de-escalatory move, the reality is that the exercise was limited by Russia&amp;#8217;s inability to generate large numbers of troops beyond those that are&lt;/p&gt;

For several years, American strategists have debated the wisdom of this weapon.

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;

Ferdinand Foch pronounced these desperate words in September 1914 as German troops massed 25 miles from Paris for their final assault. The same words could be used today by analysts and diplomats still willing to promote greater cooperation between the United States and its European allies. Just like Foch&amp;#8217;s lines, international arms development seems in full retreat as European leaders express unease about their dependence on American weapons and technologies &amp;#8212; from the F-35 to digital services. And yet, the case for more defense-industrial cooperation&lt;/p&gt;

Most recently, Intelligence Online reported that a joint investigation by Ukraine and Mexico uncovered several cases of individuals linked to Mexican cartels enlisting in the Ukrainian International Legion to gain experience using weaponized aerial drones. Reportedly, the investigation also found signs that members of Colombian insurgent groups may have done the same with the intention of bringing these skills back to the Western Hemisphere. Russia has also allegedly provided training to Colombian nonstate groups.On July 2 the Colombian navy interdicted&lt;/p&gt;

In response, European states have embarked on a major expansion of their missile defenses, covering short-, medium-, and long-range systems designed to counter everything from low-flying drones and cruise&lt;/p&gt;

While figures vary across sources, Turkey, China, the United States, and Israel consistently rank among the top exporters &amp;#8212; with Iran and Russia increasingly vying for a place in that group.Arms exports, however, serve more than just economic purposes.
