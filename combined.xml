They dig into inflated valuations, the dangers of easy capital, and the risks of betting on defense budgets that may not endure. They also examine the outlook for space companies, the role of private equity, and what it really takes for startups to survive in this sector. Image: Jack Bunja via DVIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitachi, the Japanese industrial conglomerate, is taking its advance into digital technology to the next stage with an “AI factory” based on Nvidia processors and a tie-up with OpenAI. The company is also expanding its manufacturing operations in the US. On October 2, Hitachi wrote on X: “Hitachi CEO Toshiaki Tokunaga met @OpenAI CEO Sam [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Trump administration planning to bring down Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro? The short answer is: probably not deliberately, but it might stumble that way anyway—and that&amp;#8217;s precisely the problem. The recent escalation tells a familiar story. The administration is weighing military strikes against drug cartels operating inside Venezuela as part of a broader strategy [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Western Empires fell to a new Western order – modern liberalism. Now, they are rising from the ashes, threatening liberalism. The US may be tempted to become an empire, too, but can it win when its adversaries are better at it? And can modernity survive without liberalism?

&lt;p&gt;On September 25, the US Donald Trump administration again extended the TikTok ban-or-divest law, possibly for the last time.

&lt;p&gt;Nationalism usually works on the basis that a nation should imagine itself as a “we,” with a common identity, history and culture. But it doesn’t always clearly say who the “we” are. Instead, it often works by saying who doesn’t belong – frequently by characterizing these people in racialized ways. Singapore is an interesting case [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MANILA – The Philippines on Friday said it would not allow China to militarize the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, where Beijing has recently announced it would transform the area into a nature reserve. Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Romeo Brawner said the Philippines was also looking at expanding the [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

The fight delivered a harsh reality check to U.S. military leaders. Early American confidence after Operation Torch collapsed as Axis forces, led by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, inflicted an embarrassing setback. In multiple engagements in the Atlas Mountains of west-central Tunisia between Feb. 19 and 24, unprepared U.S. forces retreated chaotically. Weaknesses were on display throughout the fighting: Poor logistics, inexperienced troops, piecemeal deployments, and ineffective leadership combined to result in a defeat that shook American morale and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have studied almost any European language, you will have noticed words that felt oddly familiar. French mort (dead) recalls English murder.

&lt;p&gt;China&amp;#8217;s leap to field a prototype &amp;#8220;Golden Dome&amp;#8221; missile shield before the US has finalized its own design signals a new phase in the rivals’ arms race, where the drive for security threatens to heighten nuclear risk.

&lt;p&gt;Huawei Technologies is preparing for a significant escalation in its artificial intelligence (AI) chip ambitions, announcing plans to double the annual output of its flagship Ascend 910C processors to 600,000 units in 2026, up from 2025 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as Washington continues to ratchet up export restrictions on Chinese chipmakers and their supply chains, thereby intensifying Beijing’s efforts to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. It was first reported by Bloomberg, which cited sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

On Sept. 27, Russian forces conducted the third-largest combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine of the war. President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the semi-annual conscription cycle. In response, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil refineries, causing widespread fuel shortages. Repairs at major refineries caused a 20 percent gasoline shortage and a 15 percent drop in September diesel production. Shortages&lt;/p&gt;

But the Alaska summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin complicated that course. Putin has exploited the diplomatic opening to intensify Russian attacks on Ukraine, without the prospect of more stringent U.S. sanctions or negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.To stop Russia from further weaponizing the peace process and slowly pushing its advantage in Ukraine,&lt;/p&gt;

The warming up began with Trump inviting Munir to lunch at the White House earlier in June &amp;#8212; the first time a U.S. president had hosted a Pakistani military chief unaccompanied by civilian leaders.

This was the first Zapad exercise since Russia&amp;#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The exercise was notably smaller than the previous one held in 2021. While Belarusian authorities presented the decrease in size as a de-escalatory move, the reality is that the exercise was limited by Russia&amp;#8217;s inability to generate large numbers of troops beyond those that are&lt;/p&gt;

To meet these challenges, the United States is engaged in a substantial modernization of its own nuclear capabilities, including a new nuclear-armed cruise missile for its submarine force, commonly referred to as &amp;#8220;SLCM-N,&amp;#8221; or sea-launched cruise missile&amp;#8211;nuclear. For several years, American strategists have debated the wisdom of this weapon.

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;

Ferdinand Foch pronounced these desperate words in September 1914 as German troops massed 25 miles from Paris for their final assault. The same words could be used today by analysts and diplomats still willing to promote greater cooperation between the United States and its European allies. Just like Foch&amp;#8217;s lines, international arms development seems in full retreat as European leaders express unease about their dependence on American weapons and technologies &amp;#8212; from the F-35 to digital services. And yet, the case for more defense-industrial cooperation&lt;/p&gt;

Most recently, Intelligence Online reported that a joint investigation by Ukraine and Mexico uncovered several cases of individuals linked to Mexican cartels enlisting in the Ukrainian International Legion to gain experience using weaponized aerial drones. Reportedly, the investigation also found signs that members of Colombian insurgent groups may have done the same with the intention of bringing these skills back to the Western Hemisphere. Russia has also allegedly provided training to Colombian nonstate groups.On July 2 the Colombian navy interdicted&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond the immediate implications for the war in Ukraine, these barrages raise a sharper question for Europe: how to respond to a Russia that wields conventional long-range strike power as a tool of coercion and war.There is now broad agreement among policymakers and analysts that Russia&amp;#8217;s missile buildup cannot go unanswered. In response, European states have embarked on a major expansion of their missile defenses, covering short-, medium-, and long-range systems designed to counter everything from low-flying drones and cruise&lt;/p&gt;

Armenia&amp;#8217;s traditional reliance on Russia for security and trade has been shaken by Moscow&amp;#8217;s ambivalent stance during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, the subsequent Azeri takeover of the region in 2023, and by disruptions in vital supply routes linked to Iran and Georgia.
