Singer and August Cole, who in 2015 published Ghost Fleet, a futuristic thriller depicting the next world war. As pioneers of the fictional intelligence genre, we invited them back to reflect on their predictions. Looking back over the last decade, which of the technologies or strategic predictions in&amp;#160;Ghost Fleet&amp;#160;have proven most prescient,&amp;#160;and which haven&amp;#8217;t developed as anticipated&amp;#160;in the novel?When we started working on Ghost Fleet in 2012, most of the focus in the national security ecosystem was on an assumed future of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;

The meeting highlighted improving relations between the two countries, following a period of intensified tensions during border clashes in 2020. This renewed engagement occurs at a time of unusually high U.S.&amp;#8211;Indian tensions, raising concerns in Washington that New Delhi might be leaning more toward China.

In response, European states have embarked on a major expansion of their missile defenses, covering short-, medium-, and long-range systems designed to counter everything from low-flying drones and cruise&lt;/p&gt;

While figures vary across sources, Turkey, China, the United States, and Israel consistently rank among the top exporters &amp;#8212; with Iran and Russia increasingly vying for a place in that group.Arms exports, however, serve more than just economic purposes.

Well, that&amp;#8217;s exactly what happened with U.S. Cyber Command.Leading into 2017, there was an ongoing debate regarding whether the U.S. Department of Defense should establish a cyber service to generate cyber forces or if cyber force generation responsibilities should be formally given to U.S. Cyber Command. Ultimately, that year, Cyber Command was given force generation responsibilities, which are to organize, equip, train, and provide forces&lt;/p&gt;

John Antal, Protection Senior Leader Forum The U.S. Army stands at the convergence of two accelerating forces: the exponential growth of battlefield technology and the finite limits of human cognition. From low earth orbit to tactical edge networks, the tools of warfare are changing faster than our cognitive infrastructure &amp;#8212; education, training, and judgment &amp;#8212; can adapt. While it&amp;#8217;s tempting to believe the answer lies in fielding faster tools, better networks, or more advanced artificial intelligence, the truth is: no amount of technology can offset a deficit in human adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

While many have paid close attention to Russia&amp;#8217;s beneficial partnership with Iran, the introduction of North Korea&amp;#8217;s legions into the Ukrainian battlespace, or persistent materiel support from China, Russia&amp;#8217;s other rising-power relationship is often underdiscussed &amp;#8212; that of India.The Russian-Indian relationship is both of longer duration and deeper history than those Russia has with its other key partners. It is also sometimes ignored as it does not extend to shared adversarial relations with the greater West. This is a mistake, as India is&lt;/p&gt;

In previous years, the United States was always at the center of the discussions.This year was different.There were far fewer Americans in attendance &amp;#8212; partially because some of the U.S. Navy ships that would have stayed after the exercise were off to deal with the Israeli-Iranian&lt;/p&gt;

The question facing U.S. strategic planners ever since has been simple but daunting. How do you stop weapons that fast, unpredictable, and affordable enough to be produced at scale?One increasingly popular answer is the Pentagon&amp;#8217;s ambitious Golden Dome initiative. It would leverage orbiting interceptors and sensors to destroy missiles (ballistic, hypersonic, cruise, and even drones) at different moments of flight. In President Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s plan, Golden Dome would be fielded in roughly two to three years at an eventual cost of about $175&amp;#8239;billion. Converting&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it became the catalyst for a new one. He first founded The Honor Foundation to help special operators bring their elite standards to civilian leadership, then launched BVVC, a venture fund backing relentlessly focused founders. He most recently assembled the founding team at Union, a munitions company designed to re-imagine munitions production. In this conversation, Musselman shares the through line in all of his work and how elite standards, trust, and execution can reshape people, networks, and organizations. &amp;#65279;Did you enjoy this episode?&lt;/p&gt;

In slick, high-energy presentations, they criticize the slow and outdated cycles of traditional military innovation and procurement. They paint vivid scenarios of future warfare where adversaries are agile, tech-savvy, and armed with autonomous systems, implying that only the most cutting-edge technology can prevail. Unsurprisingly, the solution to these looming threats aligns perfectly with the products they happen to be selling.

But all is not well in Ukraine.Until recently, it was very difficult to publicly question such materials due to the lack of publicly available battlefield statistics. But by 2025, many observers acknowledge that Russia may have surpassed Ukraine in certain areas of innovation adoption.This is now publicly acknowledged by various experts, including Ukraine&amp;#8217;s former top military commander, Michael Kofman, and others. This provides an opportunity for a more open discussion about which parts&lt;/p&gt;

Robert Oppenheimer and Gen. James Mattis, some 64 years later, the United States learns again and again that it cannot achieve its political ends with coercion alone and with more investment in soft power like humanitarian aid and diplomacy, less is needed for war.Last month, reduction-in-force notices pinged into email inboxes throughout the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration at the U.S. Department of State. When the dust settled, pursuant to the department&amp;#8217;s reorganization plan, 168 people &amp;#8212; 75 percent of the bureau&amp;#8217;s staff &amp;#8212; were gone. These firings followed the earlier dismantling of the U.S. Agency&lt;/p&gt;
