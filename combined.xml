&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s AI ambitions are taking shape not by choosing sides but by building multiple paths. Its latest move is a partnership with Tsinghua University, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison and the Indonesia Technology Alliance to create an AI Application Cooperation Center. The lab is designed to strengthen Indonesia’s AI ecosystem, foster local talent and link the archipelago [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international trade system, once a triumph of American-led multilateralism, is fracturing under the weight of Donald Trump’s second-term tariff blitz. What began as a populist revolt against perceived unfairness in free trade in the 2010s has metastasized into a calculated assault on the post-war global trading system that the United States itself designed and [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go again. President Trump has unveiled his 21-point plan for ending the Gaza war, complete with an immediate ceasefire, hostage releases within 48 hours and—naturally—a &amp;#8220;pathway&amp;#8221; to a Palestinian state. Standing alongside Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump proclaimed we&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;beyond very close&amp;#8221; to ending the war and called it a &amp;#8220;historic [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 20, 2025, US President Donald Trump warned on Truth Social that if Afghanistan “doesn’t give Bagram Airfield back … BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!” Earlier that week at a London press event, the US leader described Bagram as “an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.” While factually imprecise, the [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is poised to “sell” Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. The US special envoy to Ukraine, retired general Keith Kellogg, says only the final decision has to be made. The US has already agreed, Kellogg said, for deep attacks on Russian territory, and only the release of the Tomahawks is pending, a decision left [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a global market game changer? If Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil facilities continue and escalate, Moscow could lose much of its export capacity. This might cripple its war efforts and could have a far greater impact on the market. India, Turkey and possibly even China would need to diversify their supply chains.

&lt;p&gt;When US President Donald Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly on its 80th anniversary, his rallying cry against the “globalist migration agenda” gave a gift to regimes bent on exclusionary nationalism everywhere. For Myanmar, which has long pursued a strategy of rendering the Rohingya stateless and unwanted, the speech was more than rhetorical—it was [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping&amp;#160;hosted&amp;#160;Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing, where the two leaders observed China’s military parade. Watching it, one could be forgiven for thinking Beijing and Moscow are growing dangerously close to the detriment of the United States.

Although headlines have focused on mounting American calls for allies to spend more on defense to counter China, the drama of intra-alliance affairs has been offset by an undercurrent of relief. Unlike the vitriol directed at NATO allies, Washington&amp;#8217;s pressure for Pacific partners to do more underscores their centrality in U.S. security thinking and has helped assuage regional apprehensions of abandonment.While the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s affirmations of Washington&amp;#8217;s defense commitments are welcomed, the relative relief&lt;/p&gt;
