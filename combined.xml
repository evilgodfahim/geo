About 42 percent of the continent’s population still lives in homes without any access. While it is technically possible to rapidly increase African electrification rates through renewables, change on such a scale would require massive global investment that is not a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future. Africa’s untapped and associated gas reserves can provide part of the solution by supporting renewable energy in boosting electrification rates. &lt;/p&gt;

The biggest takeaway is that questions about war and peace in the nuclear age remain so important. Many of the people debating nuclear policy today were born after Reagan was president. Others who grew up when he was president may not have an accurate sense of what he wanted to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

Often, these changes unfold quietly, only to surface in sudden, unexpected attacks. Security experts and policymakers can overlook significant developments in terrorist strategies and trends. To shed light on these blind spots, we asked five experts to identify geographic areas or emerging patterns in terrorist activity that represent growing threats but receive insufficient scrutiny.Read more below.Tricia Bacon Professor at American University Author of the forthcoming book The Counterinsurgency Dilemma: Foreign Fighter Influence on Insurgencies in Afghanistan and SomaliaThe cooperation between al-Shabaab and the&lt;/p&gt;

Nazi Germany was far from finished and London was throughout the summer of 1944 being pounded by German V1 flying bombs, but the writing was clearly on the wall.As these events unfolded, the commander-in-chief of the Polish armed forces, Gen.
