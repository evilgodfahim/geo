&lt;p&gt;The US government shutdown couldn’t come at a worse time for federal workers. With the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed – sent home without pay until funding resumes.

John Boyd understood that clarity comes when forces are stretched to their limits. In the Western Pacific, where strategic competition is rapidly tilting toward confrontation, the first unit to show up may decide who stays. III Marine Expeditionary Force, the Marine Corps&amp;#8217; only permanently forward-deployed Marine Expeditionary Force, lives daily at that extreme. Headquartered on Okinawa with forces scattered from Guam to Japan to Hawaii, III Marine Expeditionary Force is not only the Marine Corps&amp;#8217; most combat-credible formation in the Indo-Pacific &amp;#8212; it is arguably the Joint Force&amp;#8217;s best-positioned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20-point Gaza peace plan thrashed out under the leadership of the United States and agreed to by Israel is one of the most comprehensive outlines put forward publicly by the Trump administration for ending the conflict with Hamas.

On Sept. 25, President Donald Trump hosted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan&amp;#8217;s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, at the White House, marking the latest sign of improving relations. The warming up began with Trump inviting Munir to lunch at the White House earlier in June &amp;#8212; the first time a U.S. president had hosted a Pakistani military chief unaccompanied by civilian leaders. Munir was back within two months, sitting in the front row at U.S. Central Command&amp;#8217;s change of command ceremony in Florida. Concrete policy moves accompanied this&lt;/p&gt;

In July 2025, France and the United Kingdom, Europe&amp;#8217;s two nuclear powers, announced stronger nuclear coordination in the Northwood Declaration, Lancaster House 2.0, and the U.K.-France Leaders Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;

The meeting highlighted improving relations between the two countries, following a period of intensified tensions during border clashes in 2020. This renewed engagement occurs at a time of unusually high U.S.&amp;#8211;Indian tensions, raising concerns in Washington that New Delhi might be leaning more toward China.
