&lt;p&gt;If you have studied almost any European language, you will have noticed words that felt oddly familiar. French mort (dead) recalls English murder. German Hund (dog) is a dead ringer for hound. Czech sestra resembles English sister. No prizes for guessing the meaning of Albanian kau (OK, well – it’s actually ox). You might have [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&amp;#8217;s leap to field a prototype &amp;#8220;Golden Dome&amp;#8221; missile shield before the US has finalized its own design signals a new phase in the rivals’ arms race, where the drive for security threatens to heighten nuclear risk.

On Sept. 27, Russian forces conducted the third-largest combined missile and drone strike against Ukraine of the war. President Vladimir Putin announced the start of the semi-annual conscription cycle. In response, Ukraine has targeted Russian oil refineries, causing widespread fuel shortages. Repairs at major refineries caused a 20 percent gasoline shortage and a 15 percent drop in September diesel production. Shortages&lt;/p&gt;

To meet these challenges, the United States is engaged in a substantial modernization of its own nuclear capabilities, including a new nuclear-armed cruise missile for its submarine force, commonly referred to as &amp;#8220;SLCM-N,&amp;#8221; or sea-launched cruise missile&amp;#8211;nuclear. For several years, American strategists have debated the wisdom of this weapon.

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;
