&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is rising and could tip the scales among Israel’s old friends and allies. The answer could be to look beyond Gaza and think of a future for ordinary Palestinians. Israeli popularity in Europe and the West is rapidly slipping. Old friends, including Australia, Britain, Canada and France, will recognize a Palestinian state. The United [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s biggest revolving door is spinning again, and odds are it’s about to spit out Shinjiro Koizumi as the nation’s next prime minister. It’s not that a critical mass of Japan’s 125 million people seem enthusiastic about the 44-year-old son of 2001–2006 leader Junichiro Koizumi taking a turn running Asia’s No 2 economy. It’s more [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will officially launch its new K-visa scheme on October 1, aiming to attract foreign professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Beijing&amp;#8217;s initiative arrives at a moment of intensifying competition for skilled workers worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;In the campaign to lead Japan&amp;#8217;s long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and most likely to become the country&amp;#8217;s new prime minister, the first phase – featuring the heaviest concentration of party-sponsored public events and debates – is over and it is possible to make some preliminary notes on what we have learned thus far.

Poland&amp;#8217;s air force command issued a quick reaction alert, scrambling Polish F-16 and Dutch F-35 fighters to identify and, if necessary, eliminate the threat. NATO also launched an Italian airborne command and control aircraft and alerted German Patriot air defense missile units on the ground.

&lt;p&gt;The US has imposed a 50% tariff on most Indian exports, following through on its threat to raise them from 25%. Although they are formally applied to goods, there are fears that tariffs could also unleash a domino effect on IT services.

Singer and August Cole, who in 2015 published Ghost Fleet, a futuristic thriller depicting the next world war. As pioneers of the fictional intelligence genre, we invited them back to reflect on their predictions. Looking back over the last decade, which of the technologies or strategic predictions in&amp;#160;Ghost Fleet&amp;#160;have proven most prescient,&amp;#160;and which haven&amp;#8217;t developed as anticipated&amp;#160;in the novel?When we started working on Ghost Fleet in 2012, most of the focus in the national security ecosystem was on an assumed future of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.

An exception to this pattern of inaction is in West Africa. After the failed mutiny of Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023, the Russian government established a new paramilitary group called Africa Corps, tethered closely to the military chain of command. The unit then progressively took over most of Wagner&amp;#8217;s operations&lt;/p&gt;

The meeting highlighted improving relations between the two countries, following a period of intensified tensions during border clashes in 2020. This renewed engagement occurs at a time of unusually high U.S.&amp;#8211;Indian tensions, raising concerns in Washington that New Delhi might be leaning more toward China.

From low earth orbit to tactical edge networks, the tools of warfare are changing faster than our cognitive infrastructure &amp;#8212; education, training, and judgment &amp;#8212; can adapt. While it&amp;#8217;s tempting to believe the answer lies in fielding faster tools, better networks, or more advanced artificial intelligence, the truth is: no amount of technology can offset a deficit in human adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

In many European states, there is growing public support for this. National governments can leverage this moment of heightened public concern to devote more resources to defense. However, sustaining the type of long-term, consistent spending that European countries would need to develop strong and independent defense capabilities will require cutting spending elsewhere or raising tax revenues &amp;#8212; which in turn will require maintaining public support over multiple years.We asked experts to consider why publics in five key&lt;/p&gt;

The question facing U.S. strategic planners ever since has been simple but daunting. How do you stop weapons that fast, unpredictable, and affordable enough to be produced at scale?One increasingly popular answer is the Pentagon&amp;#8217;s ambitious Golden Dome initiative. It would leverage orbiting interceptors and sensors to destroy missiles (ballistic, hypersonic, cruise, and even drones) at different moments of flight. In President Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s plan, Golden Dome would be fielded in roughly two to three years at an eventual cost of about $175&amp;#8239;billion. Converting&lt;/p&gt;

Brad Carson (former defense official and member of Congress) of Americans for Responsible Innovation and Liza Tobin (former CIA and National Security Council staffer) of Garnaut Global join Ryan to explore what this reversal says about America&amp;#8217;s approach to protecting its tech edge, whether NVIDIA&amp;#8217;s justifications hold water, why normal Americans should care about this, and what it could mean for the future of AI and semiconductor strategy.&amp;#160;This episode also features&lt;/p&gt;

In the last two decades, China has shown increasing interest in promoting its soft power &amp;#8212; perhaps most notably through its Belt and Road Initiative. In addition to that enormous project, China also pursues less well-known ways to promote its image, narrative, and relationships through culture, business, technology, media, and more. We asked five experts to provide their insights on important forms of Chinese soft power &amp;#8212; and how it is or is not having an effect.Read&lt;/p&gt;

This was no act of self-defense. It was, in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&amp;#8217;s telling, an act of protection: Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa&amp;#8217;s government, in power since the fall of Bashar al-Assad in December, failed to protect the Druze from Sunni violence, compelling Israel to intervene on the minority&amp;#8217;s behalf.Just like that, Netanyahu unearthed what seems like a relic from a bygone era: the Responsibility to Protect, a principle rarely mentioned these days outside specialized humanitarian circles.

Instead, it became the catalyst for a new one. He first founded The Honor Foundation to help special operators bring their elite standards to civilian leadership, then launched BVVC, a venture fund backing relentlessly focused founders. He most recently assembled the founding team at Union, a munitions company designed to re-imagine munitions production. In this conversation, Musselman shares the through line in all of his work and how elite standards, trust, and execution can reshape people, networks, and organizations. &amp;#65279;Did you enjoy this episode?&lt;/p&gt;

They paint vivid scenarios of future warfare where adversaries are agile, tech-savvy, and armed with autonomous systems, implying that only the most cutting-edge technology can prevail. Unsurprisingly, the solution to these looming threats aligns perfectly with the products they happen to be selling.
