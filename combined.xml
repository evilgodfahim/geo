&lt;p&gt;The economic consequences of the current federal government shutdown hinge critically on how long it lasts. If it is resolved quickly, the costs will be small, but if it drags on, it could send the U.S. economy into a tailspin.

General Assembly officially centered on the Sustainable Development Goals and challenges such as climate change and AI governance. Yet, during the week of high-level meetings from Sept. 22&amp;#8211;30, pressing global conflicts played a key role in both formal speeches and informal discussions. The Israeli&amp;#8211;Palestinian crisis and Myanmar&amp;#8217;s ongoing civil war drew special attention through dedicated events, while other conflicts featured prominently in speeches and side meetings as well.To better understand the implications, we asked five experts to assess what this year&amp;#8217;s U.N.
