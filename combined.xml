&lt;p&gt;On September 17, 2025, US President Donald Trump telephoned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to wish him a happy 75th birthday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described their conversation as &amp;#8220;wonderful&amp;#8221; and pledged to strengthen ties between the two countries—a gesture that initially raised hopes of easing tensions after the imposition of a [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs may have been Donald Trump’s weapon of choice, but China’s export engine is proving impervious to his trade war. Despite the US president&amp;#8217;s best efforts, China’s trade surplus is on track to end 2025 at US$1.2 trillion, topping last year’s nearly $1 trillion figure. The reason is that China has become adept at adapting, [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evolving security landscape of Northeast Asia, South Korea stands at a crossroads. For Seoul, the dilemma is stark: Embrace the popular nuclear impulse or sustain the US alliance and the global non-proliferation regime. Complicating matters, President Lee Jae Myung’s first US visit – intended to consolidate alliance assurances – was overshadowed by controversy. [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the world is focused on a two-state solution in resolving the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears devoted to realizing his vision of a “Greater Israel” instead. Netanyahu appears to be halfway through achieving this goal, despite all the international condemnation of his war in Gaza and the increasing [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 17, 2025, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement in Riyadh. The text’s most striking line—“any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”—moves the two longtime partners from quiet security cooperation to a formal collective-defense pledge. For New Delhi, which has simultaneously deepened ties with Riyadh [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

Although headlines have focused on mounting American calls for allies to spend more on defense to counter China, the drama of intra-alliance affairs has been offset by an undercurrent of relief. Unlike the vitriol directed at NATO allies, Washington&amp;#8217;s pressure for Pacific partners to do more underscores their centrality in U.S. security thinking and has helped assuage regional apprehensions of abandonment.While the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s affirmations of Washington&amp;#8217;s defense commitments are welcomed, the relative relief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&amp;#8217;s Fujian supercarrier has launched stealth jets into the sky in a dramatic show of force that signals the country&amp;#8217;s intent to reset the balance of power at sea. This month, multiple media outlets reported that China&amp;#8217;s newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, launched and recovered its next generation of carrier-based aircraft — the J-35 stealth [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the air and ground war in Ukraine grinds on, Moscow is increasing pressure on Kyiv’s western allies. Russian drone incursions into Poland in the early hours of September 10, and Romania a few days later, were followed by three Russian fighter jets breaching Estonian airspace on September 19. And there has been speculation that [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

About 42 percent of the continent’s population still lives in homes without any access. While it is technically possible to rapidly increase African electrification rates through renewables, change on such a scale would require massive global investment that is not a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future. Africa’s untapped and associated gas reserves can provide part of the solution by supporting renewable energy in boosting electrification rates. &lt;/p&gt;
