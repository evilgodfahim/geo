&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, one of us (Myles Allen) asked a Chinese delegate at a climate conference why Beijing had gone for “carbon neutrality” for its 2060 target rather than “climate neutrality” or “net zero,” both of which were more fashionable terms at the time.

&lt;p&gt;People’s lives are more enmeshed with digital systems than ever before, increasing users’ vulnerability and insecurity. From data leaks like the 2017 Equifax data breach to the more recent cyberattack on British retailer Marks &amp;#38; Spencer, business operations and data on the internet continue to be vulnerable.

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a very short, oversimplified history of modern economics. In the 1960s and 1970s, a particular way of thinking about economics crystallized in academic departments and basically took over the top journals. It was very math-heavy, and it modeled the economy as the sum of a bunch of rational human agents buying and selling things [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific, Japan is remilitarizing its Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in a manner not seen since the end of World War II. To maintain a threshold of deterrence, Japan and the United States are growing their mutual defense capabilities to new heights. The United States military has deployed the Typhon missile system [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of the death of the US dollar appear to be greatly exaggerated (like that of author Mark Twain). Global trading in the foreign exchange market has risen to almost US$10 trillion per day. This figure comes from a survey released overnight by the Bank for International Settlements covering transactions in April. By comparison, global [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#8217;s quiet arming and training of China&amp;#8217;s paratroopers sharpens Beijing’s airborne edge for a Taiwan strike—but significant capability gaps and formidable defenses still cloud the odds of success.

Yet, during the week of high-level meetings from Sept. 22&amp;#8211;30, pressing global conflicts played a key role in both formal speeches and informal discussions. The Israeli&amp;#8211;Palestinian crisis and Myanmar&amp;#8217;s ongoing civil war drew special attention through dedicated events, while other conflicts featured prominently in speeches and side meetings as well.To better understand the implications, we asked five experts to assess what this year&amp;#8217;s U.N.

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s AI ambitions are taking shape not by choosing sides but by building multiple paths. Its latest move is a partnership with Tsinghua University, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison and the Indonesia Technology Alliance to create an AI Application Cooperation Center.

&lt;p&gt;The international trade system, once a triumph of American-led multilateralism, is fracturing under the weight of Donald Trump’s second-term tariff blitz. What began as a populist revolt against perceived unfairness in free trade in the 2010s has metastasized into a calculated assault on the post-war global trading system that the United States itself designed and [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go again. President Trump has unveiled his 21-point plan for ending the Gaza war, complete with an immediate ceasefire, hostage releases within 48 hours and—naturally—a &amp;#8220;pathway&amp;#8221; to a Palestinian state. Standing alongside Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump proclaimed we&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;beyond very close&amp;#8221; to ending the war and called it a &amp;#8220;historic [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

About 42 percent of the continent’s population still lives in homes without any access. While it is technically possible to rapidly increase African electrification rates through renewables, change on such a scale would require massive global investment that is not a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future. Africa’s untapped and associated gas reserves can provide part of the solution by supporting renewable energy in boosting electrification rates. &lt;/p&gt;
