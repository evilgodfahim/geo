&lt;p&gt;When &amp;#8220;Red Rain&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Mua Do&amp;#8221;) stormed into Vietnamese cinemas this August, it didn’t just break records — it rewrote them. In just over 20 days, the war epic sold more than 6.6 million tickets and earned about 600 billion dong (roughly US$24.6 million) at the domestic box office, according to official tallies reported by Tuoi [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US&amp;#8217;s Replicator project, billed as a way to swarm China with &amp;#8220;small, smart, cheap&amp;#8221; drones, has been grounded by delays, spiraling costs and software chaos, raising questions about the Pacific balance of power in a fast-moving new era of drone warfare.

&lt;p&gt;Is it a global market game changer? If Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil facilities continue and escalate, Moscow could lose much of its export capacity. This might cripple its war efforts and could have a far greater impact on the market. India, Turkey and possibly even China would need to diversify their supply chains.

&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is rising and could tip the scales among Israel’s old friends and allies. The answer could be to look beyond Gaza and think of a future for ordinary Palestinians. Israeli popularity in Europe and the West is rapidly slipping. Old friends, including Australia, Britain, Canada and France, will recognize a Palestinian state. The United [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s biggest revolving door is spinning again, and odds are it’s about to spit out Shinjiro Koizumi as the nation’s next prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that a critical mass of Japan’s 125 million people seem enthusiastic about the 44-year-old son of 2001–2006 leader Junichiro Koizumi taking a turn running Asia’s No 2 economy. It’s more that the politically moderate, generally inoffensive scion of a family dynasty looks like the least worst option to replace Shigeru Ishiba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Koizumi, he steps into some rather small shoes. One has to get extremely creative to argue that Ishiba achieved much during his 11-plus months in the premiership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishiba spent most of his time explaining his latest U-turn from previously held policy positions. He never found his groove with voters, something painfully clear following the Liberal Democratic Party’s disastrous showing in July 20 elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will officially launch its new K-visa scheme on October 1, aiming to attract foreign professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Beijing&amp;#8217;s initiative arrives at a moment of intensifying competition for skilled workers worldwide.
